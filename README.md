# ArchitectureExample
A Modularized architecture example


This is just one example of a modularized dll referenced layered architecture showing how you could separate dependencies from a front-end application. The purpose of this example is to display how to keep front-end applications thin and to only have references to the assemblies they need. This is to not break the single responsibility principle.
